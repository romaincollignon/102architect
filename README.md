## :rocket: Introduction

    You are working on a homeplanning software for an architecture firm. The goal
    is to simplify the process of
    drawing the plan, and to integrate various features such as scale management,
    changing the point of view, moving doors and windows along walls...
    You are in charge of implementing the geometric transformations (rotation to
    change point of view, translation to move an object, scaling to zoom in and
    out, reflection and any combination of these transformations).
